        My Communication Philosophy
      </h3>

      <p>
        I don't see myself as just a developer who builds web services. I treat
        every project as a collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        I try to understand the problem we are solving and stay in constant
        communication with both development team and the business side.
      </p>

      <p>
        In past experiences, I've worked with small teams where the process
        wasn't always clear and the requirements were vague. I learned not to
        assume things will go as expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, I make sure to share my expectations from my team, ask about
        theirs, and speak up if I think something could be improved.
      </p>

      <p>
        If something doesn't make sense, I ask. Worst case? I get an answer.
        Some of those questions actually helped uncover important things we were
        missing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good communication creates a clearer, healthier work environment. It
        helps the team stay on the same page, more productive, and in the long
        run, saves time and money for the business.
